# My Web Development Journey ðŸŒ±

Hello, I'm Michael Schertel! I'm excited about my first blog entry on github pages **June 2025**. ðŸš€

This year, Iâ€™ve decided to take coding seriously. Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s always interested me, and after lots of thinking, Iâ€™ve made the decision to dive in headfirst. My goal is to develop the skills I need to start working in tech by next year.

Iâ€™m still in the early stages, but Iâ€™m excited to learn and grow. Iâ€™m currently focusing on the basicsâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”and hope to get comfortable with more advanced languages like Python and Java later on. The plan is to build a solid foundation, then tackle real-world projects to test what Iâ€™ve learned.
